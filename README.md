# Project 1
In this project we investigated the performance of two regression models, namely k-nearest neighbours and decision trees, on predicting COVID-19 hospitalization cases from related symptoms search

# Project 2
Built a Softmax Regression Model and analyzied its Hyper-parameters of the optimization procedure, Termination condition and Comparison against another classifier

# Project 3
In this project, we implemented a Convo- lutional Neural Network(CNN) Model with leNet as our model architecture and Stochas- tic gradient descent(SGD) as our optimizer. The model is then trained with a modified MNIST dataset by dividing the dataset into training and validation datasets. The time- consumed, validation loss and accuracy of our model are then compared on our dataset to investigate the effects of using different hyper-parameters and optimizers. We achieved accuracy = 99.46% and ranked 24th in the Kaggle competition(Dec 13th, 2020).
